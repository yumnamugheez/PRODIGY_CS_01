# Ceaser Cipher Encryption and Decryption Program

## Introduction

Welcome to the Ceaser Cipher encryption and decryption program! This Python program is designed to help you encrypt and decrypt text using the classic Ceaser Cipher algorithm. It is developed as part of an internship project at Prodigy, where the focus is on cybersecurity.

## Ceaser Cipher Algorithm

The Ceaser Cipher is a simple and widely used encryption technique. It involves shifting the letters of the alphabet by a certain fixed number of positions. This shift value serves as the key for both encryption and decryption.

## How to Use the Program

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/your-username/ceaser-cipher.git](https://github.com/yumnamugheez/PRODIGY_CS_01.git)
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   Change your working directory to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd ceaser-cipher
   ```

3. **Run the Program:**
   Execute the Python script to run the Ceaser Cipher program:
   ```bash
   python ceaser_cipher.py
   ```

4. **Input Message and Shift Value:**
   The program will prompt you to enter the message you want to encrypt or decrypt. Additionally, you will be asked to provide the shift value.

5. **Select Operation:**
   Choose whether you want to encrypt or decrypt the message by entering 'E' or 'D' respectively.

6. **View the Result:**
   The program will display the result of the selected operation - the encrypted or decrypted message.

## Example

Here's a quick example to help you get started:

```bash
python ceaser_cipher.py

Enter the message: Hello, Prodigy!
Enter the shift value: 3
Select operation (E for encryption, D for decryption): E

Encrypted Message: Khoor, SurjlfB!
```
